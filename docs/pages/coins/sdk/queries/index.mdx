# Coin Queries

The Coins SDK provides a comprehensive set of query functions to fetch information about coins, profiles, and related data.

## Overview

The query functions are divided into several categories:

1. **[Coin Queries](/coins/sdk/queries/coin)**: Retrieve information on specific coins such as metadata, market data, and comments
2. **[Profile Queries](/coins/sdk/queries/profile)**: Retrieve information associated with users/wallets like holdings and activity
3. **[Explore Queries](/coins/sdk/queries/explore)**: Retrieve information about all coins (new, trending, top gainers, etc.)

## Using the REST API

The Coins SDK can be used from any programming language via the **[Public REST API](/coins/sdk/public-rest-api)**. This includes:

- Interactive API documentation with live testing
- Authentication with API keys
- Code examples in multiple languages (Python, Go, Ruby, etc.)
- OpenAPI specification

For JavaScript/TypeScript usage, continue reading below. For other languages, see the [Public REST API documentation](/coins/sdk/public-rest-api).

## API Key Setup

Before using the API queries in a high-usage production environment, set up an API key:

```ts twoslash
import { setApiKey } from "@zoralabs/coins-sdk";

// Set up your API key
setApiKey("your-api-key-here");
```

To obtain an API key:

1. Log in or create an account on [Zora](https://zora.co)
2. Navigate to [Developer Settings](https://zora.co/settings/developer)
3. Create an API key
4. Use the API key in the SDK

For detailed authentication instructions and REST API usage, see the [Public REST API documentation](/coins/sdk/public-rest-api).
