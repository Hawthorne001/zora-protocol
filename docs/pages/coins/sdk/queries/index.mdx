# Coin Queries

The Coins SDK provides a comprehensive set of query functions to fetch information about coins, profiles, and related data. This page details the available query functions, their parameters, and usage examples.

## Overview

The query functions are divided into several categories:

1. **[Coin Queries](/coins/sdk/queries/coin)**: Retrieve information on specific coins such as metadata, market data, and comments
2. **[Profile Queries](/coins/sdk/queries/profile)**: Retrieve information associated with users/wallets like holdings and activity
3. **[Explore Queries](/coins/sdk/queries/explore)**: Retrieve information about all coins (new, trending, top gainers, etc.)
4. **[Onchain Queries](/coins/sdk/queries/onchain)**: Fetch data directly from the blockchain (API strongly recommended, only recommended for advanced users)

## API Key Setup

Before using the API queries in a high-usage production environment, you'll need to set up an API key:

```ts twoslash
import { setApiKey } from "@zoralabs/coins-sdk";

// Set up your API key
setApiKey("your-api-key-here");
```

To get an API key, the process is currently manual. Please DM us at [x.com/zoradevs](https://x.com/zoradevs) or (open a ticket)[https://support.zora.co] and we'll get you set up.

There currently is no charge for an API key and we only utilize them to monitor usage and contact production users of our API.


## Non-Javascript Usage

The Coins SDK API can be used in any language that supports HTTP requests.

Full API documentation can be found [on the SDK site](https://api-sdk.zora.engineering/docs) with a dynamic editor and an openapi definition file.

The paths and function names map directly to the SDK functions which can be used to document the usage of these API paths.
