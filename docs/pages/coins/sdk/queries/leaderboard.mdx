# Leaderboard Queries

The Coins SDK exposes queries for weekly Featured Creators and the Trader Leaderboard.

- These queries support optional `year` and `week` parameters.
- Weeks use ISO week numbering (starting at 1).
- If `year` and `week` are not provided, the current ISO week and year are used.
- Passing a specific `year` and `week` retrieves data for that week of that year.

## getFeaturedCreators

Retrieves a weekly featured creators list. Supports optional `year`, `week`, and pagination via `first` and `after`.

```ts twoslash
import { getFeaturedCreators } from "@zoralabs/coins-sdk";

async function fetchFeaturedCreators() {
  // If year/week not passed, uses the current week/year by default
  const response = await getFeaturedCreators({
    year: undefined, // optional
    week: undefined, // optional
    first: 10,       // optional: page size
  });

  return response.data?.traderLeaderboardFeaturedCreators?.edges?.map((e: any) => e.node);
}
```

## getTraderLeaderboard

Retrieves the weekly trader leaderboard. Supports optional `year`, `week`, `first`, and `after`.

Passing in a `year` and `week` will return the leaderboard for that specific week of the year. If no year or week is passed in, it will return the current week's leaderboard.

```ts twoslash
import { getTraderLeaderboard } from "@zoralabs/coins-sdk";

async function fetchTraderLeaderboard() {
  // Defaults to the current week/year when omitted
  const response = await getTraderLeaderboard({
    year: undefined, // optional
    week: undefined, // optional
    first: 10,       // optional: page size
  });

  return response.data?.exploreTraderLeaderboard?.edges?.map((e: any) => e.node);
}
```
