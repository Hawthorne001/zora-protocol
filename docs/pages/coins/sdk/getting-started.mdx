# Getting started

The Coins SDK is a library that allows you to create, manage, and query data for Zora coins.

Most features available on the Zora product on web and native mobile apps are available in the SDK and API.

## Installation

The SDK is available on NPM and can be installed using the following command:

```bash
npm install @zora-protocol/coins-sdk
```

## Usage

The SDK integrates with `fetch` and `viem` for on-chain interactions and writes.

It can be used on both client and server environments.

## Non-javascript environments

If your product does not support or use a javascript environment, you can use the API endpoints and ABIs directly to interact with the protocol.

The [Coins SDK API](/coins/sdk/queries#non-javascript-usage) can be used in any language that supports HTTP requests.
