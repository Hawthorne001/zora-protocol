# Protocol Rewards

## Introduction

At Zora, we are passionate about providing the best experience to create and earn onchain.
**Protocol Rewards** is a split of the Zora mint fee allowing:

- Creators to monetize their work
- Developers to earn from NFT mints and creations they facilitate

[Rewards escrow contract code](https://github.com/ourzora/zora-protocol/tree/main/packages/protocol-rewards)

## Address

Rewards v1.1 is deployed at the same address on all networks.

0x7777777F279eba3d3Ad8F4E708545291A6fDBA8B

## Coin Trading Rewards (V4)

The latest V4 coins use an advanced hook-based reward system that automatically converts and distributes rewards through multi-hop swaps to reach the target payout currency.

### V4 Reward Distribution

| Recipient       | Percentage |
| --------------- | ---------- |
| Creator         | 50% |
| Create Referral | 15% |
| Trade Referral  | 15% |
| Protocol        | 15% |
| Doppler         | 5% |

### Key V4 Features

- **Multi-Hop Reward Swapping**: Automatically converts rewards through intermediate tokens to reach the final payout currency
- **Gas Efficient**: All conversions happen in a single transaction through the hook system
- **Unified Currency Distribution**: All recipients receive rewards in the same target currency (e.g., USDC)
- **Recursive Path Resolution**: Handles complex coin-to-coin-to-currency conversion paths

For example, if a content coin is paired with a creator coin, which is paired with USDC:
1. LP fees are collected in both the content coin and creator coin
2. Content coins are swapped to creator coins
3. Creator coins are swapped to USDC
4. All rewards are distributed in USDC to recipients

## Legacy Trading Rewards (V3)

V3 coins use the original reward distribution system with separate currency and coin rewards.

### V3 Reward Distribution

| Recipient       | Percentage |
| --------------- | ---------- |
| Creator         | 50% |
| Create Referral | 15% |
| Trade Referral  | 15% |
| Protocol        | 15% |
| Doppler         | 5% |

Note: V3 rewards are distributed in both the coin and its backing currency separately.

#### ERC20 Mint

| Recipient       | Amount       |
| --------------- | ------------ |
| Creator | 95% of earnings from sales |
| Mint Fee | 5% of listed purchase price|
| Create Referral | 28.57% of Mint Fee |
| Mint Referral   | 28.57% of Mint Fee |
| First Minter    | 14.23% of Mint Fee |
| Zora            | 28.63% of Mint Fee |


**Mint Referral**: The platform that referred a specific mint of an NFT  

**Create Referral**: The platform that referred the creator to deploy the NFT collection. The creator is determined by the royaltyRecipient of the token followed by the funds recipient of the contract.

**First Minter**: Only for premints, this is the first collector to execute the premint. In a non-premint context, this reward is paid out to the creator of the NFT. *Note: For ERC20 Mints, the creator is set as the First Minter and earns First Minter rewards by default.*

## Coin Rewards Terminology

**Trade Referral**: The platform or address that referred a specific trade/swap of a coin. In V4, this is passed through hook data and can trigger referral rewards.

**Create Referral**: The platform that referred the creator to deploy the coin. This is set at coin creation time and earns a percentage of all trading fees.

**Creator/Payout Recipient**: The address designated to receive creator rewards from trading activity. This can be updated by coin owners.

**Protocol**: The ZORA protocol treasury that receives a portion of trading fees.

**Doppler**: The governance entity that receives a small percentage of trading fees.

## How It Works: Creator

1. Creator selects coin creation parameters including payout recipient
2. Creator specifies a wallet address eligible to claim their rewards
3. Creator opens up their coin for trading -- **that's it!**

The creator's total rewards are automatically distributed with each trade:
- **V4**: Converted to target currency and sent directly to payout recipient
- **V3**: Accumulated in escrow and can be withdrawn at any time

## How It Works: Developer

### Create Referral Reward

The create referral reward is paid out to the developer or platform that referred the creator to deploy their coin using Zora's contracts.

#### Creating a Coin with Rewards

The `createReferral` address is specified upon coin creation through the factory's deploy function.

```solidity
function deploy(
    address payoutRecipient,
    address[] memory owners,
    string memory uri,
    string memory name,
    string memory symbol,
    bytes memory poolConfig,
    address platformReferrer, // This is the create referral
    uint256 orderSize,
    string memory message,
    bytes32 salt
) external payable returns (address, uint256);
```

### Trade Referral Reward

The trade referral reward is paid out to the party that referred a specific trade.

#### V4 Trading with Referrals

For V4 coins, trade referrals are passed through the hook data when executing swaps via the Universal Router or other compatible interfaces.

#### V3 Trading with Referrals

For V3 coins, trade referrals are specified in the buy/sell functions:

```solidity
function buy(
    address recipient,
    uint256 orderSize,
    uint256 minAmountOut,
    uint160 sqrtPriceLimitX96,
    address tradeReferrer
) external payable returns (uint256, uint256);
```

## Withdrawing Rewards

### V4 Coins
Rewards are automatically distributed on each trade - no withdrawal needed!

### V3 Coins and NFT Rewards
Rewards must be withdrawn from the escrow contract, which address can be found [in the readme](https://github.com/ourzora/zora-protocol/tree/main/packages/protocol-rewards).

```solidity
function withdraw(address to, uint256 amount) external;
```

Withdraw for another address directly.

```solidity
function withdrawFor(address to, uint256 amount) external;
```

```solidity
function withdrawWithSig(
    address from, 
    address to,
    uint256 amount, 
    uint256 deadline, 
    uint8 v, 
    bytes32 r, 
    bytes32 s
)
```
