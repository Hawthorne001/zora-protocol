# `Coin.sol`

The `Coin` contract is the core contract for the Zora Coins Protocol. It is an non-upgradeable ERC20 contract that allows for the creation of media coins.

## Overview

The `Coin` contract implements the `ICoin` interface, which extends several standard interfaces:
- `IERC165`: Standard interface detection
- `IERC721Receiver`: Enables receiving ERC721 tokens (for LP tokens)
- `IERC7572`: Standard for protocol-specific metadata

Each coin is created with a Uniswap V3 liquidity pool, enabling immediate trading functionality.

## Key Features

- **ERC20 Functionality**: Basic token transfers, approvals, and balance tracking
- **Trading**: Built-in buy and sell functions with Uniswap V3 integration. Allows for owners to trade without approvals on uniswap.
- **Reward Distribution**: Mechanisms for distributing rewards to creators, referrers, and the protocol
- **Metadata Management**: Updatable contract metadata via URI
- **Multi-Ownership**: Support for multiple owners with permission control

## Core Functions

### Trading

#### Buy

```solidity
function buy(
    address recipient,
    uint256 orderSize,
    uint256 minAmountOut,
    uint160 sqrtPriceLimitX96,
    address tradeReferrer
) external payable returns (uint256, uint256);
```

This function allows users to buy coins using ETH or the configured trading currency (typically WETH). The buyer sends the currency and receives newly minted coins in return.

Parameters:
- `recipient`: The address that will receive the purchased coins
- `orderSize`: The amount of currency to spend (in wei)
- `minAmountOut`: Minimum amount of coins to receive (slippage protection)
- `sqrtPriceLimitX96`: Price limit for the UniswapV3 swap (0 for no limit)
- `tradeReferrer`: Address that receives a portion of the trading fee (optional)

Returns:
- The actual amount of currency spent and coins purchased

#### Sell

```solidity
function sell(
    address recipient,
    uint256 orderSize,
    uint256 minAmountOut,
    uint160 sqrtPriceLimitX96,
    address tradeReferrer
) external returns (uint256, uint256);
```

This function allows users to sell their coins in exchange for ETH or the configured trading currency. The coins are burned during the sale.

Parameters:
- `recipient`: The address that will receive the currency proceeds
- `orderSize`: The amount of coins to sell
- `minAmountOut`: Minimum amount of currency to receive (slippage protection)
- `sqrtPriceLimitX96`: Price limit for the UniswapV3 swap (0 for no limit)
- `tradeReferrer`: Address that receives a portion of the trading fee (optional)

Returns:
- The actual amount of coins sold and currency received

#### Burn

```solidity
function burn(uint256 amount) external;
```

Allows users to burn their own tokens, permanently removing them from circulation.

### Management Functions

#### setContractURI

```solidity
function setContractURI(string memory newURI) external onlyOwner;
```

Updates the coin's metadata URI. This can only be called by an owner of the coin.

#### setPayoutRecipient

```solidity
function setPayoutRecipient(address newPayoutRecipient) external onlyOwner;
```

Updates the address that receives creator rewards. This can only be called by an owner of the coin.

### Query Functions

```solidity
function tokenURI() external view returns (string memory);
function platformReferrer() external view returns (address);
```

These functions provide access to key coin information:
- `tokenURI`: Returns the coin's metadata URI
- `platformReferrer`: Returns the address of the platform referrer who earns fees from trades

## Events

The contract emits various events to track important actions:

### CoinBuy

```solidity
event CoinBuy(
    address indexed buyer,
    address indexed recipient,
    address indexed tradeReferrer,
    uint256 coinsPurchased,
    address currency,
    uint256 amountFee,
    uint256 amountSold
);
```

Emitted when coins are purchased, tracking the buyer, recipient, trade referrer, amount of coins purchased, currency used, fees paid, and total amount spent.

### CoinSell

```solidity
event CoinSell(
    address indexed seller,
    address indexed recipient,
    address indexed tradeReferrer,
    uint256 coinsSold,
    address currency,
    uint256 amountFee,
    uint256 amountPurchased
);
```

Emitted when coins are sold, tracking the seller, recipient, trade referrer, amount of coins sold, currency received, fees paid, and total amount received.

### CoinTransfer

```solidity
event CoinTransfer(
    address indexed sender,
    address indexed recipient,
    uint256 amount,
    uint256 senderBalance,
    uint256 recipientBalance
);
```

Emitted on any token transfer, providing detailed information about the transfer including updated balances.

### CoinTradeRewards

```solidity
event CoinTradeRewards(
    address indexed payoutRecipient,
    address indexed platformReferrer,
    address indexed tradeReferrer,
    address protocolRewardRecipient,
    uint256 creatorReward,
    uint256 platformReferrerReward,
    uint256 traderReferrerReward,
    uint256 protocolReward,
    address currency
);
```

Emitted when trade rewards are distributed, tracking all reward recipients and amounts.

### CoinMarketRewards

```solidity
event CoinMarketRewards(
    address indexed payoutRecipient,
    address indexed platformReferrer,
    address protocolRewardRecipient,
    address currency,
    MarketRewards marketRewards
);
```

Emitted when market rewards (from liquidity pool fees) are distributed.

### ContractMetadataUpdated

```solidity
event ContractMetadataUpdated(
    address indexed caller,
    string newURI,
    string name
);
```

Emitted when the contract metadata URI is updated.

### CoinPayoutRecipientUpdated

```solidity
event CoinPayoutRecipientUpdated(
    address indexed caller,
    address indexed prevRecipient,
    address indexed newRecipient
);
```

Emitted when the payout recipient is updated.

## Error Handling

The contract defines several custom errors that provide specific information about failed operations:

- `AddressZero`: Operation attempted with a zero address
- `InsufficientFunds`: Insufficient funds for the operation
- `InsufficientLiquidity`: Insufficient liquidity for a transaction
- `SlippageBoundsExceeded`: Slippage bounds exceeded during a transaction
- `InitialOrderSizeTooLarge`: Initial order size too large
- `EthAmountMismatch`: ETH value doesn't match the currency amount
- `EthAmountTooSmall`: ETH amount too small for the transaction
- `ERC20TransferAmountMismatch`: Unexpected ERC20 transfer amount
- `EthTransferInvalid`: Invalid ETH transfer
- `EthTransferFailed`: ETH transfer failed
- `OnlyPool`: Operation only available to the Uniswap pool
- `OnlyWeth`: Operation only available to WETH
- `MarketNotGraduated`: Market hasn't graduated yet
- `MarketAlreadyGraduated`: Market has already graduated
- `InvalidCurrencyLowerTick`: Invalid tick configuration
- `InvalidWethLowerTick`: Invalid WETH tick configuration
