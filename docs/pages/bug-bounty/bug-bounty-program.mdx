- Social engineering attacks targeting Zora staff are strictly prohibited.
- Publishing sensitive information discovered during security testing is prohibited.
- Vulnerabilities already known to Zora are ineligible for rewards.
- Please provide thorough reports with clear steps that can be replicated. If your report lacks sufficient detail to reproduce the issue, it will not be accepted.

### Disclosure Policy

For responsible management of vulnerability disclosures, keep all discussions related to these vulnerabilities, including resolved ones, strictly within the program. Additionally, do not disclose them externally within 90 days of remediation or without Zora's explicit consent. Failure to comply with the Disclosure Policy may result in the loss of any potential reward. Your adherence to this policy greatly enhances the program's safety and integrity.
