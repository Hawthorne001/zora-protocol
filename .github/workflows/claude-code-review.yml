            Please review this pull request and provide feedback on:
            - Code quality and best practices
            - Potential bugs or issues

            - Test coverage
            
            **Important: Changeset Validation**
            If this PR modifies contract code (*.sol files in packages/*/src/), please check:
            1. Is there a changeset file in .changeset/ directory?
            2. If contract code changed but no changeset exists, remind the author to add one using `pnpm changeset add --empty` and manually edit it
            3. According to CLAUDE.md: "When updating contract code, make a changeset for the corresponding contract package"
            
            Be constructive and helpful in your feedback.
